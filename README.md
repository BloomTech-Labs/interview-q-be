# API Documentation

#### Backend deployed at [Heroku](https://interview-q-staging.herokuapp.com/) <br>
Contact Labs19 team for alternate deployment.
## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

### Node.js + graphql-yoga + Prisma + Apollo Federation

We chose this framework for:

- Scalability: since the QualityHub project currently includes Core and InterviewQ (but will include future modules, like ResumeQ, etc.), we wanted to set up a gateway that would connect the different back-ends
- Simplicity: we wanted to set up a gateway so that the various front-end apps associated with the QualityHub project would only need to hit one endpoint
- Flexibility: we chose to implement GraphQL to make it easier for future front-end developers to access the backend schema

## Endpoints

#### Organization Routes & User Routes

InterviewQ: https://interview-q-staging.herokuapp.com

This GraphQL back-end API is connected to the overall project via Apollo Federation through the Gateway here: https://quality-hub-gateway-staging.herokuapp.com


# Data Model

Specific schemas (data models, queries, mutations) for the GraphQL back-end API can be accessed at the link above. Additional documentation is viewable in the GraphQL Playground for the Federation Gateway.

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

For dynamic deployment, env-cmd is recommended. in the ./config directory you may specify different environment files for different purposes. For local development, the development.env file can be created and used. See Docker information below to more details.

- JWT_SECRET - Used for authentication - must match between each federation member.
- PRISMA_ENDPOINT - specifies prisma service endpoint.
- PRISMA_SECRET - specifies secret to access prisma.
- PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET - not in use. Specifies the secret to manage Prisma.
- PRISMA_PORT - Port on which Prisma service Runs
- APOLLO_PORT - Port on which Apollo Server Runs
- PG_USER - Postgres DB username.
- PG_PASSWORD - Postgres DB password.

## Documentation

See [Frontend Documentation](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/quality-hub-core-fe) for details on the front-end of our project.

## Local Development

Requirements: NodeJS, Prisma CLI, and Docker (Docker Desktop was used)

### Initialization

cd to src directory, check out a new feature branch using `git checkout -b <feature-name>`, make sure new feature branch is even with functional master branch (may be production in some cases).

Run `npm i` to install dependencies, check package.json to verify that `env-cmd` has been added.

Run `docker-compose up` to start a Docker container from `docker-compose.yml`

`docker-compose.yml` contains information which docker-compose will use to build the Prisma and Postgres services for this repository.

An .env file is needed at the root directory with the following variables defined:

- `PRISMA_ENDPOINT`, `PRISMA_SECRET`, `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`

cd to src/prisma and run `prisma deploy -e ..config/development.env`

This will build a Prisma service from prisma.yml and datamodel.prisma and deploy it according to the environment variables contained in src/config/development.env listed below

- `PRISMA_ENDPOINT`, `PRISMA_SECRET`, `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`

cd to the parent directory `cd ..`

Run `npm run development` This executes the development script which assigns the .env variables to those contained in /config/development.env and will start an instance of node at the assigned port. _This endpoint will be specified in the Gateway's environment variable and assigned to its corresponding service._

### Updating Prisma Service

If changes are made to datamodel.prisma, the service will need to be deployed using `prisma deploy -e ../config/development.env` following that, the Prisma client will need to be generated. Run `prisma generate -e ../config/development.env` This updates src/generated with the latest version of Prisma Client.


## Production Deployment
Utilize seed.graphql to seed data containing industry types. Execute the command `prisma seed` with optional `-e` + environment file to seed this data.
